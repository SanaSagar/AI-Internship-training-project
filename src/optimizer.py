Prompt Optimizer
================
Uses the LLM itself to analyze why a prompt failed and generate an improved version.

Strategies:
1. Constraint Injection — adds length limits, format rules
2. Negative Examples — tells the AI what NOT to do
3. Direct Instruction — rewrites the prompt to be extremely explicit

ORIGINAL PROMPT: {original_prompt}

EXPECTED WORD COUNT: {expected_word_count} words

ANALYSIS RULES:
- The expected output is {expected_word_count} words long. The rewritten prompt MUST ask for a response of similar length.
- If the expected output is 1-2 sentences, the prompt must say "Answer in 1-2 sentences" or "Keep it under {expected_word_count + 5} words."
- If the expected output is a list, the prompt must specify the exact format (e.g., "comma-separated", "numbered list").
- If the expected output is code, the prompt must say "Return only the code, no explanations."
- Add "Do not add extra information, greetings, or explanations" to prevent verbosity.

STRATEGY: {strategy}
{"- Completely rewrite the prompt from scratch. Make it impossible for the AI to give a wrong answer." if strategy == "CRITICAL_REWRITE" else ""}
{"- Add specific constraints: word limits, format rules, and negative instructions (what NOT to do)." if strategy == "ADD_CONSTRAINTS" else ""}
