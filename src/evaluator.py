Evaluator Module
================
Evaluates LLM responses using three methods:
1. Semantic Similarity — do the meanings match?
2. Length Deviation Penalty — is the response too long/short?
3. LLM-as-Judge — does an AI think the answer is correct?

Also generates human-readable feedback explaining the scores.
